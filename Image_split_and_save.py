    """
    Given a directory of images, this function takes each image and splits it 
    into as many non-overlapping images of target_size shape as will fit. It 
    then saves each new, split image into the target_image_directory.
    New saved image has a name of the format "name-00001" for the first
    image split from image called name

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_directory : string
        Directory destination containing all the images that are required to be
        split.
    target_image_directory : string
        Directory destination where the split images will be saved.
    target_size : tuple, optional
        The dimensions that you require the original image to be split into.
        The default is (200,200).

    Returns
    -------
    None.
